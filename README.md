# Ray

I mean... it's a raycaster. Hopefully it'll turn into a game at some point.

## To-do:

- [X] Only capture pointer if the function exists
- [X] Allow dev hiding
- [X] Auto detection for ray count
- [X] Fix fisheye
- [ ] Better distance -> height function
- [ ] Distance = darker wall color
- [ ] Resize changes number of rays
- [ ] Add WebGL support
- [ ] Clean up the `main.js`
- [ ] Clean up `canvas.js`
- [ ] Clean up `rays.js`
